# Brute Stack Code

## A stack-oriented language

The origin of the Brute Stack Code was because of the Red Power's minecraft mod computer which implemented the FORTH language. This means Brute Stack Code is inspirated from FORTH language

## How it works:
Brute Stack Code uses a stack (FIFO envorinment) to manipulate data and a RAM-like to store temporary data for later use.


Programs can only has a stacktrace (function tracing stack) of size 50 elements.


The program stack technically is infinite-size and also DOES NOT HOLD float numbers, only 16-bit signed integers.

## Extensions:
[Official extensions on Brute Stack Code](extensions.md)


## Commands:
All commands on this paper will be defined in the list as:
COMMANDNAME \[1st hardcoded argument which will be fetched on the command string] \[2nd hardcoded argument which will be fetched on the command string] \[...] \<1st arbitrary argument. Pops a value from the stack and defines as the first argument> \<2nd arbitrary argument. Pops a value from the stack and defines as the second argument> <...>
### Commands list
- . \<value>: Pops a value from the stack and displays it on the terminal.
- .S \<...values>: Pops all values from the stack and displays it on the terminal with spaces between the numbers
- P3: Named P-Cubed, PÂ³ or PPP, it means Pop-Push-Push, basically clone a value in the stack
- E: Stops the program
- RE: Restart the program (memory is not cleared)
- CL: Clears the stack
- PAGE: Clears the terminal
- WORDS: Displays all the command names
- TR \<length> \<...char codes>: Pops a length value and then iterate through 0 to length, popping a char code and displaying it's character on the screen
- TW \<length>: Pops a length value and then reads length bytes from input and push all of the readed values on the stack
- \+ \<argument 1> \<argument 2>: Pops two values from the stack and makes a addition operation, then push the result in the stack
- \- \<argument 1> \<argument 2>: Pops two values from the stack and makes a subtraction operation, then push the result in the stack
- \* \<argument 1> \<argument 2>: Pops two values from the stack and makes a multiplication operation, then push the result in the stack
- / \<argument 1> \<argument 2>: Pops two values from the stack and makes a division operation, then push the result in the stack. Note that the result is floored.
- % \<argument 1> \<argument 2>: Pops two values from the stack and makes a division operation, then push the remainder in the stack
- | \<argument 1> \<argument 2>: Pops two values from the stack and makes a OR operation, then push the result in the stack
- ! \<argument 1> \<argument 2>: Pops two values from the stack and makes a NOT (xor of 65535) operation, then push the result in the stack
- & \<argument 1> \<argument 2>: Pops two values from the stack and makes a AND operation, then push the result in the stack
- ^ \<argument 1> \<argument 2>: Pops two values from the stack and makes a XOR operation, then push the result in the stack
- IFQ \<argument 1> \<argument 2>: Check if both values is equal, if true, executes all commands inside the if statement until a ELSE or END is found
- INQ \<argument 1> \<argument 2>: Check if both values is NOT equal, if true, executes all commands inside the if statement until a ELSE or END is found
- IFS \<argument 1> \<argument 2>: Check if both values is smaller, if true, executes all commands inside the if statement until a ELSE or END is found
- IFB \<argument 1> \<argument 2>: Check if both values is bigger, if true, executes all commands inside the if statement until a ELSE or END is found
- ELSE: If inside a if statement, skips commands until a END is found. Otherwise should trigger a error
- END: If inside a if statement, does nothing. Otherwise should trigger a error
- DF \[...code, stops after a EF command]: Defines a function. First read the function name then reads commands until a EF command is found. If the function is not closed properly, should wait for user input until the user inputs a EF command. NOTE: DF and EF CANNOT BE USED inside another function, IT NEEDS TO BE USED AND ONLY USED on the main function.
- EF: Ends the function definition.
- CALL \[function name]: Read a function name then calls the function
- FF \[function name]: Removes the function from the function definition list.
- R \<address>: Pops a address from the stack. Reads a 16-bit integer from the memory using the specified address.
- W \<address> \<value>: Pops a address THEN the value from the stack. Writes a 16-bit integer to the memory using the specified address and value.
- SIZE: Pushes the memory size
- EXTS: Pushes a bitfield of the supported extensions by the interpreter.
- CEXTS: Pushes a bitfield of extensions that are loaded in the interpreter.
- USEXTS \<extension>: Pops the extension bitfield and then activates all the supported extensions by the interpreter. If a not supported extension was marked, the command should give a error. If a already activated extension was marked in the bitfield the interpreter should ignore it.
- "\[...characters]": Converts all characters inside quotation marks to char codes and pushes it on the stack.
- (any integer): pushes the integer into the stack

### Note: If statements can be chained together, example:
```bsc
10 10 IFQ 20 10 INQ 0 . ELSE 1 . END ELSE 1 . END
```
This means if you're trying to create a interpreter you need to know whenever the if statement should skip a ELSE/END statement or not

## Errors:
- NO ARGS: If a command needs 1 or more values from the stack and the stack is empty between the execution of the command this error appears, example: `10 +`
- NUM2BIG: If the value which will be pushed on the stack is overflows the 16-bit integer limit, this error appears. Example: `2 10 6000 * *`
- DF CANNOT BE USED INSIDE A FUNCTION. CANCELED: Self explanatory. NOTE: The interpreter should remove the function declaration of the memory if this error appears, in other words after this error appears the function is treated as it never was declared in the first place, this means that the CALL command will give a NOT FOUND error. Example: `DF DF`
- NO COMMAND: Appeared if the command that the interpreter tried to execute is a invalid command. Example: `NON_EXISTING_COMMAND`
- INVALID FUNCTION NAME: If the DF command was reading a EOF (End Of File), the function ONLY contains numbers or the function name is a reserved word (a command name) this error appears. Example: `DF 20 EF DF WORDS EF`. NOTE: a function that STARTS WITH NUMBERS but HAS LETTERS is trated as a non invalid name. Example: `DF 10_add 10 + EF 20 CALL 10_add .`
- INVALID FUNCTION CLOSING: If the EF command was used without a DF command first, this error appears. Example: `20 10 40 50 EF`
- STACKTRACE OVERFLOW: If the interpreter detects that the stacktrace length is above the stacktrace limit (50 functions called per program) this error appears. Example: `DF call_bomb CALL call_bomb EF CALL call_bomb`
- NO FUNCTION: If the CALL command couldn't find the function specified, this error appears. Example: `CALL no_function`
- INVALID ADDRESS: If the range of the address is below 0, this error appears. Example: `-1 R -2 10 W`
- INVALID IF: If any if statement couldn't find a END statement, this error appears. Example: `30 20 INQ 0 .`
- INCOMPATIBLE EXTENSION: If the program tried to activate a unsupported extension, this error appears.

## Tests:
### Test the IFS and IFB commands:

Pseudo-code (lua):
```lua
if 10 < 20 then
    if 20 + 10 > 2 then
        print(0);
    else
        print(1);
    end
else
    print(2);
end
```
Brute Stack Code:
```bsc
20 10 IFS 2 10 20 + IFB 0 . ELSE 1 . END ELSE 2 . END
```
Returns 0 if everything is ok

Returns 1 if IFB is not working

Returns 2 if IFS is not working



### Test the IFQ and INQ commands:

Pseudo-code (lua):
```lua
if (2 + 6*5) ~= (8 + 4*6) then
    if (4 + 2*14) == ((360 % 99 - 3)/2+2) then
        print(0);
    else
        print(1);
    end
else
    print(2);
end
```
Brute Stack Code:
```bsc
2 5 6 * + 8 6 5 * + INQ 4 14 2 * + 2 2 3 99 360 % - / + IFQ 0 . ELSE 1 . END ELSE 2 . END
```
Returns 0 if everything is ok

Returns 1 if IFQ is not working

Returns 2 if INQ is not working
